/// @notice           This contract was decompiled using the heimdall-rs decompiler.
///                     It was generated directly by tracing the EVM opcodes from this contract.
///                     As a result, it may not compile or even be valid solidity code.
///                     Despite this, it should be obvious what each function does. Overall
///                     logic should have been preserved throughout decompiling.
///
/// @custom:github    You can find the open-source decompiler here:
///                       https://github.com/Jon-Becker/heimdall-rs
///
/// @custom:donations Heimdall is open source and will always be free to use, so 
///                     donations are always appreciated if you find it helpful.
